Fairly simple program, its my first Python project. 
To use, grab out your top trumps, of one of the 'supported' ones, and open the program.
Enter your card name, and the program will smartly see what stats your card beats the most cards in, eg: (yourcard) beats 10 cards in cuteness, but beats 15 in size, and so on.
The statistic with the most wins will be spit out for you to hopefuly win your game

Eventual fetures:
Remove already played cards (on your side)
Add non case-sensitivity



Happy playing!
